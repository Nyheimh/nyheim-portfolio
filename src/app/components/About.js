Full-stack software engineer with over two years of experience in React, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, Next.js, and React Native. I excel in problem-solving, thrive on innovation, and have a strong foundation in business communications and analysis.

My recent role at connectRN involved crafting high-performing, scalable code, translating design concepts into functional software, and seamlessly integrating third-party libraries. I am passionate about continuous learning, especially in frontend, backend, and mobile development. I am drawn to impactful projects in areas like healthcare, education, and social justice. Additionally, I prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and seek like-minded companies to collaborate with. I am eager to connect with recruiters and fellow engineers who share my vision and enthusiasm.
